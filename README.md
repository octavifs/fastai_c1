# Fast.ai course (part I)

This repo will cover the lessons, with their corresponding notebook and exercises as I do them, following the [Fast.AI MOOC](http://course.fast.ai).

Each lesson will have a Dockerfile and a conda environment which can be used to create a GPU-ready image. This should make the environments reproducible and fully functional.
